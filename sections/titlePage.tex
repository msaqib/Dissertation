%God almight often enables people to do tasks that they are incapable of. First and foremost, All praise and gratitude to Allah! Secondly, I would not be where I am, if it weren't for my parents. While that is true biologically, I wouldn't be where I am but for their unwavering support since I joined the PhD program. My wife has also been a great help. While she did get upset on late nighters on campus while she was home with the kids, deep down, she was always committed. My daughters brought me the joy that was so essential when my nerves were tested. My friends at LUMS, especially Zeeshan ALi Rana, Junaid Akhter, Khwaja Muhammad Umar Suleman and Aadil Zia Khan brought smiles into otherwise dull environment.

%My advisor's input has been a key ingredient in all that I have done so far. If I were given another life, I might not do a PhD :-), but if I do, I'd pick him as the advisor for sure. In fact, if it weren't for the way he kept me focused, I might have been tempted by an exciting job offer. Dr. Fahad Rafique Dogar and Dr. Ihsan Ayub Qazi also helped shape my thesis at a crucial juncture. Dr. Fareed Zaffar also played a very constructive and supportive role. Even though Dr. Naveed Arshad (probably) never helped me in research, I certainly looked up to the advice that he gave to us PhD students in general.
