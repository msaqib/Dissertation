\chapter{A generalized framework for electricity cost optimization}
\label{chap:framework}

\section{Modeling the electricity cost minimization problem in networks and systems} Discuss how different network types can periodically use RP and WR to minimize electricity costs. Show that this problem is NP-Hard. Describe the concept of network state and motivate a state trajectory optimization problem. Describe transition costs and formulate a mathematical optimization problem. 
\subsection{The objective function} Provide the mathematical form of the objective function that is designed to solve the optimal state trajectory problem.
\subsection{The constraints} Comment on some of the network-specific constraints that the optimization must be subject to.
