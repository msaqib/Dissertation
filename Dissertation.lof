\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces An example of mapping variable workload to capacity-limited network resources with geo-temporal diversity in electricity prices. Three consecutive intervals $t_1$, $t_2$ and $t_3$ are considered. Workload and electricity prices may only change between two consecutive intervals. (a) Workload considered in this example. (b) Electricity prices for the locations at which the two network resources are situated. (c) A uniform mapping of workload to network resources does not exploit electricity price diversity. (d) Mapping workload to network resources in order of their current electricity price. Due to lack of energy proportionality, only slight savings in electricity cost are possible. (e) Deactivating idle resources alongwith the resource mapping strategy of (d) may result in significant electricity cost savings.}}{30}{figure.3.1}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces A motivating example that depicts the workload-mapping problem for three consecutive intervals involving three data centers of equal capacity. For this example, the workload is assumed to be constant equal to 1.3 times the capacity of a single data center, in all three intervals. Of many possible states in each interval, we show just three example candidate states along with the electricity cost for being in those states. Cost of transition from one state to another in the next interval are also labeled on the arrows representing the state transition.}}{40}{figure.4.1}
